Quantum Random Walks applied in Qiskit to a Historical Citation Network

Contents of repo: 
- __alteredstartingnode.ipynb__- a simple 8 node quantum walk that allows you to start at any node in the graph

- __functions.py__- Clean prepocessing functions incljuding those that initialized the multiple quantum walks so we are able to publsih them as a separate module at the end.

- __resultstrial2-9.csv__- results from trial1, excise the nomenclature

- __trial1.ipynb__- First application of a CTQW to the actual Historical network starting on node 9
