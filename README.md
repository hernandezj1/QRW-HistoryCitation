# QRW-HistoryCitation
Quantum Random Walks applied in Qiskit to a Historical Citation Network

Contents of repo: 
- __Images__- folder that contains the images where the citations occur in the three books that connect the work of node 9 to 7 and 8.

- __8-node-trial.ipynb__- 8 - node application for proof of concept
  
- __quantum_results_starting_on_node_4_8_nodes.csv__ - simulated results of 8-node trial
  
- __quantum_results_starting_on_node_4_8_nodes_IBM.csv__ - quantum device results of 8-node trial

- __citation_network.ipynb__- First simulated application of a CTQW to the actual Historical network starting on node 9

- __resultstrial2-9.csv__- results from citation network, excuse the nomenclature
  
- __node_mapping.csv__- keeps track of the renamed nodes from the citation network so we can make inferences from the results
  
- __functions.py__- Clean prepocessing functions incljuding those that initialized the multiple quantum walks so we are able to publsih them as a separate module at the end.
